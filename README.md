# Graph Project  

A project that contains most of the Graph Algorithms.  

## What is inside?
- Graph Properties (IsBipartite, IsCircular,...)  
- Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS)
- Graph Algorithms which includes:  
    - Dijkstra
    - Ford-Fulkerson
    - Prim
    - Kruskal
    - Eulerian and Hamiltonian
    - ...

## How to use?
- Download this project  
- Use either Visual Studio or Jetbrain Rider, open the solution file
- Build the project
- Run  

## TODO
- Implement Boykov-Kolmogorov approach.
- Code cleanup.  
- Use more optimised approach to avoid confusion.  




### Please note that not all of the algorithms are optimised (i.e Hamiltonian,...). If you have any suggestions, please do a pull request. I would appreciate it.  

### Bugs are expected, please note that I'm not an expert in Graph Theory, things might go wrong. If you want to support, just do a pull request.
